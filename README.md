# Building Reservation Manager

## An application that automates the reservations of buildings and the rooms inside

The application will be able to aid in the management of buildings accessible to the public.

*The application will be able to*:
- add buildings and add rooms to those buildings  
- show a list of all available buildings and the rooms of those buildings
- allow the user to search for buildings by name and rooms by name or id.
- book a room if a room is unbooked
- un-book a room if a room is booked
- a room or building can be put into maintenance status
- alert users when they attempt to book rooms that cannot be booked
- retrieve lists of rooms that require maintenance or are not booked
- special rooms can be created (eg. cannot be booked but requires maintenance)

The main targeted audience of the project will be facilities that own buildings that can be reserved by large amounts of people, such as those of a library. The application would be superior to keeping records on paper or typed documents as it will automatically check whether a room is unavailable, improving the efficiency of the task and removing the error of booking a booked/maintenance needed room or building. 
 
I built this project because I was interested in the software that automated the management of records. While the task of record keeping is simple, handling large amounts of data is tiring and invites error when done manually. I think the automation of such tasks is one of the best qualities of modern life, the fact that the click of a mouse has replaced flipping the pages of thick record book. As well, since this kind of software is relatively common, I feel that the amount of available knowledge would help my understanding of modern techniques.
